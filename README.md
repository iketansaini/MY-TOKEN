# MyToken

MyToken is an ERC20-compatible token contract implemented in Solidity.

## Overview

MyToken provides a basic token functionality, allowing users to mint and burn tokens. It includes the following features:

- Minting new tokens and assigning them to specific addresses.
- Burning tokens from a specific address.

## Token Details

- Name: MyToken
- Symbol: MTK
- Total Supply: 0 (initially)

## Getting Started

To use or deploy this token contract, you need to have a Solidity development environment set up. You can compile and deploy the contract using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

## Deployment

1. Deploy the `MyToken` contract to a compatible Ethereum network or a local blockchain.
2. After deployment, the contract will have an initial total supply of 0.

## Usage

The contract exposes the following functions:

### `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`

Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified `to` address.

### `burn(address from, uint256 amount)`

Burns tokens from the specified `from` address.
